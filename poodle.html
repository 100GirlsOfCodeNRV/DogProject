<h1> About toy poodles!</h1>

<p>Even though they may seem small, they still have a personality. They're pretty awesome,
even if they're considered "prissy little dogs" by some people. *shakes fist at those people*
some people also think they're vicious, which some are, but most are not. They come in all
different colors like black, white, tan, browm, etc. These dogs are good for kids and little old ladies. :)</p>
