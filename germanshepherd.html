<title>About the german shepherd!</title>
<body>
<p>Even though in the picture it's quite small, it can grow to be a lot bigger
  since the dog in the picture is only a puppy. German shepherds are friendly, playful
dogs and very active. They're probably not the best around small kids, but they're great for older kids. (Even if they do slobber a bit) </p>
